# Welcome to the `sysbasic-notes` repository!

## Introduction 

 This is a collection of simple "how-to" notes, as well as some favorites of  </b>
 mine which I chose to include. Everything here, even the special picks, are  </b>
 designed to be the best succint explanations possible. They all revolve        
 around basic instructions for using Ubuntu, Generic Linux, or just user dev  </b> 
 strategies in general. The only caveat is that they will always be for UNIX  </b>
 or simply just 'UNIX-like' systems.                                   

 The collection will just continue to grow. Its intended for just one of my   </b>
 close friends to be able to adjust to his new system, but ill open it for    </b>
 public consumption I suppose. Not that it has much value, but I hope that    </b>
 someone out there gets some use out of it. Maybe someday, ill have a child   </b>
 who can learn UNIX from me, even if im not around to teach them myself...    </b>

### Licensing

 So, this is all my own notes, but some of it is based on other documents.    </b>
 I obviously always state it ahead of time, but im gonna go out on a limb     </b>
 and say that I can attach my own license to all of it. After all, I might    </b>
 have used other docs for it, but its all praphrased by me. I actually did    </b>
 so intentionally. If theres anything here that violates your copyright,      </b>
 please bring it to my attention. But I did this in a way to where you can    </b>
 hopefully not even claim that.         

 Remember, generic and simple conclusions that someone may get to on their    </b>
 own without outside help, arent generally protected. Nor is the concept of   </b>
 a piece of information in general. Especially since a lot of this is from    </b>
 open source material, AND paraphrased/rewritten and so on, I only pasted     </b>
 this because I am pretty confident here. But I am always open to your own    </b>
 interpretations; If you think I ripped you off, please speak up and we can   </b>
 have a look at it. If you are correct, I will gladly concede. Not that any   </b>
 person or organization has anything to gain from me and my tiny project,     </b>
 but I know how it is sometimes. Its about the principle, and so on.
